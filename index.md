<h1> Brain Entropy </h1>

Thanks for you are interesting to our study. Here is overview about this workshop,you also can download the <a href="https://github.com/donghui1119/SEW_Brain_Entropy/raw/main/SEW_Brain_Entropy_DonghuiSong.pdf"> PPT </a> about Brain and Entropy. I will update the content if I am free in the someday.


<h2> 1.Entropy from Thermodynamic to Brain Science </h2>

<h3> 1.1 What is the Entropy </h3>

- Entropy is a scientific concept as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty.

<h3> 1.2 Entropy in Thermodynamic </h3>

- The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process; it never decreases. An important implication of this law is that heat transfers energy spontaneously from higher- to lower-temperature objects, but never spontaneously in the reverse direction.

<h3> 1.3 Entropy in Information Theory </h3>

- In information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of "information", "surprise", or "uncertainty" inherent to the variable's possible outcomes.

<h3> 1.4 Entropy in Biological Signal Measure </h3>

- Pincus (1991) introduced Approximate Entropy (ApEn) , a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. 


- Sample Entropy (SampEn) is a modification of approximate entropy (ApEn), used for assessing the complexity of physiological time-series signals, diagnosing diseased states.

<h2> 3. fMRI-based Brain Entropy Mapping </h2>

- Dr. Ze Wang (2014) proposed a fMRI-based Brain Entropy Mapping for resting-state fMRI using sample entropy, you can find the original paper from
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089948"> Brain Entropy Mapping Using fMRI </a>,and he created a Brain Entropy Mapping Toolbox named BENtbx. You can download BENtbx from <a href="https://github.com/zewangnew/BENtbx"> https://github.com/zewangnew/BENtbx</a> or go to  <a href="https://cfn.upenn.edu/zewang/BENtbx.php"> https://cfn.upenn.edu/zewang/BENtbx.php </a> to download the sample data and matlab code.
